# crate-motor
*crate-motor* is a SPARC compiler for several, increasingly complex subsets of the Swift programming language.

It is an exercise in doing stuff with compilers, because I want to.

crate-motor was largely inspired by CMSC430: Introduction to Compilers at the University of Maryland, and is in many ways my own interpretation of it. That being said...

# Notice to UMD Student Honor Council
The code within this repository is based on publically available course materials, and not the projects. If any student somehow manages to pill something relevant to a project from this code, I will eat my Doc Martens.

# Structure
This project consists of
- flame, a data-based representation of SPARC instructions
- a set of Swift subsets implemented with flame
